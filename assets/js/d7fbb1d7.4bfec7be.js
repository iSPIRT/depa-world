Developing such models is challenging, especially for smaller banks, who do not have access to a large existing customer base whose profiles can be used to train models. A framework that makes a bulk labelled dataset of anonymized loan applications can reduce the cost of developing accurate risk assessment models. This can lead to better, more customized financial products that meet the requirements of different cohorts of users, and eventually benefit the entire ecosystem. "),(0,i.kt)("p",null,"For this scenario, a training dataset can be constructed by aggregating loan application datasets from multiple lenders. Each dataset in turn consists of loan applications. Each loan application in turn consists of bank statement data, tax data (for MSMEs), data from the credit bureau, and the terms on which the loan was offered. Each application also includes labels e.g., a label representing whether the borrower repaid or defaulted on the loan. Since all data for a specific loan application is often available from one lender, it is often not essential to join data from one lender with data from other lenders or sources. Therefore, the lender can de-identify the dataset to a large extent e.g., by scrubbing all PII data such as name, age, gender, and addresses.
